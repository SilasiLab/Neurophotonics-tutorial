This package of sample data and matlab codes will process, filter, and average raw voltage sensitive dye images, generate a comprehensive connectivity matrix and a network diagram (as seen in Lim et al., 2012, 2014). 

Requirements: Matlab (with Bioinformatics Toolbox and Brain Connectivity Toolbox)
Inputs: sample data; Matlab functions; Mask.tif (as included in .zip file)
Outputs: dF/F0(%) VSD connectivity matrix; Figure of network properties as a function of threshold levels; Network diagram

To use this package: 
1. Unzip data files and ensure all Matlab functions are in the same directory as the NetworkAnalysis_VSD.m
2. Open NetworkAnalysis_VSD.m with Matlab
3. In NetworkAnalysis_VSD.m, enter the folder name where the data is stored (line 5)
4. Execute code.
